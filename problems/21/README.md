Problem 21: Late for School
</h1>

<h4 align="center">
Sarah woke up late for school and needs to be there at 8:30 AM. She quickly brushes her teeth, puts on her clothes and eats breakfast. If it takes her 15 minutes to get dressed, 5 minutes to brush her teeth, and 10 minutes to eat breakfast,<br/> what time does she need to wake up in the morning to make it to school on time?
